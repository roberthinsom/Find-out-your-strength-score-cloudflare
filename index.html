        <h2>What is the DOTS Calculator?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>DOTS Calculator</strong> is a powerful assessment tool designed to help individuals uncover their key strengths and developmental areas. Based on the DOTS framework—Development, Opportunity, Talent, and Strength—the calculator evaluates multiple dimensions of personal and professional potential. Unlike traditional personality tests or skill assessments, which may focus on isolated factors, the DOTS Calculator provides a holistic view of your abilities.</p>
        <p>The DOTS framework is built around four critical areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Measures your ability to grow and expand your skills, indicating your readiness for continuous improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Assesses your capability to identify and seize opportunities in your career or personal life.</li>
            <li><strong>Talent:</strong> Highlights your natural skills or inclinations in specific areas, such as creativity, problem-solving, leadership, or technical expertise.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Identifies the key strengths you have honed through experience, showing where you stand out in your field or endeavors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By combining insights from these four pillars, the <strong>DOTS Calculator</strong> generates a "Strength Score" that reflects your overall capabilities. This score provides a clear picture of where you excel, where you can improve, and how you compare to others in similar contexts.</p>
